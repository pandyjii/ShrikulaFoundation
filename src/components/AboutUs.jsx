            The indigenous rich culture of Bharat has suffered grave humiliation
            in the past few centuries. Our dharma was mocked, our Gurukuls were
            forced to shut, our people were stripped from their possessions and
            many from their source of livelihood. In fact, many new studies are
            still being done to acknowledge the quantum of damage done to Bharat
            by medieval & modern colonialists.
          </p>
          <p>
            An inherent brilliance of its people & the blessings from the gods
            has made Bharat a competent player on the global stage in recent
            years. Our samskaras, aspirations, and consistent focus on education
            has helped Bharat achieve new milestones in fields like SpaceTech,
            IT, services, trade, sports, innovation, and many others.
          </p>

            Bharat is brimming with its aspiring youth, and this opportunity can
            only be optimally utilised if this vibrant energy is tuned well &
            given precise direction. Our civilisation stands at a very important
            crossroad of its journey, and we believe that effective decisions
            cannot be taken by physically, mentally & spiritually weak people.
            Strength translates to Confidence; Knowledge to Empowerment.

            LitFest where we allow inter-mixing of ideas, culture, language &

            an initiative to create a brand which takes Kashmir to the world &
            enlightens it with the wealth of inter-disciplinary knowledge
            systems we prepare to churn. We aim to facilitate our youth an
            atmosphere which allows comprehensive education & true empowerment.
          </p>

            children, skill-developing schools for youth & scholarships for the
            deserving. In our humble attempts, weâ€™ve received unprecedented
            support and assistance from many individuals as well as

            our efforts, and in gratitude to the Mother Divine for everything.
